## 🎓 Understanding the Issues

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- **CORS:** Any website can access your API
- **Rate Limiting:** No protection from brute force
- **Command Injection:** System commands not sanitized
- **Default SECRET_KEY:** JWT tokens can be forged

### 🟠 High Priority
- **No Admin RBAC:** Any user can access admin
- **In-Memory DB:** Data lost on restart
- **No HTTPS:** Man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Input Sanitization:** Injection vulnerabilities

### 🟡 Medium Priority
- **Gradio Public:** No authentication required
- **No Refresh Tokens:** Poor user experience
- **No Security Logs:** Can't detect attacks
- **Git Safety:** Risk of exposing secrets

### 🔵 Low Priority (Best Practices)
- **Dependency Scan:** Unknown vulnerabilities
- **Hardcoded Paths:** Portability issues
- **No Backups:** Data loss risk
