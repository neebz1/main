## 🔥 Pro Tips to Stay Error-Free

### 1. **Update Cursor Regularly**
- Menu → "Check for Updates" (once a week)
- Prevents compatibility issues

### 2. **Don't Install Random Extensions**
- Only install what you need:
  - Cline (for AI agent)
  - Language support (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
  - Nothing else unless required

### 3. **Keep API Keys in .env File**
```bash
# Create .env file in your project
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env
```
- Cursor and Cline will read from here automatically
- Never commit .env to GitHub (it's in .gitignore)

### 4. **Use Keyboard Shortcuts (No Errors!)**
```
⌘K    = Generate/edit code (AI)
⌘L    = Chat with AI
⌘⇧P   = Command palette (find any command)
⌘,    = Settings
⌘⇧X   = Extensions
⌘⇧E   = File explorer
```

### 5. **If Something Breaks → Restart Cursor**
- 90% of issues are fixed by: `⌘Q` → Reopen Cursor
- It's not a bug, it's a feature! 😅
