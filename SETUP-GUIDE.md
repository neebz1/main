## 🎯 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Run Setup Script

```bash
cd /Users/nr/main
./setup-everything.sh
```

The script will:
1. ✅ Verify Python 3.8+ is installed
2. ✅ Create virtual environment (`venv/`)
3. ✅ Install all Python packages
4. ✅ Create `.env` template
5. ✅ Make all scripts executable
6. ✅ Test installations
7. ✅ Generate quick reference

**Time:** ~60 seconds (depending on internet speed)

### Step 2: Add Your API Keys (Optional but Recommended)

Edit the `.env` file and add your API keys:

```bash
nano .env
```

Or use any text editor. Required keys for full functionality:
- `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` - For Kimi K2 music AI
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - For multiple AI models
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude AI
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For GPT models (optional)

**Don't have API keys?** Some features will still work with free alternatives!

### Step 3: Start Using!

Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Launch any tool:
```bash
./start-music-ai.sh          # Music Copilot
./start-ai-mixing-engineer.sh # Mixing Engineer
./start-live-ai-assistant.sh  # Voice Assistant
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Python not found"
**Solution:** Install Python 3.8+
```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install python3

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

# Check version
python3 --version
```

### "Permission denied" when running scripts
**Solution:** Make scripts executable
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

### "Module not found" errors
**Solution:** Reinstall dependencies
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_lite.txt
pip install -r requirements_mixing.txt
```

### "Port already in use"
**Solution:** Stop other instances or use different port
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :7860

# Kill the process (replace PID)
kill -9 PID
```

### Virtual environment issues
**Solution:** Recreate environment
```bash
rm -rf venv/
./setup-everything.sh
```
