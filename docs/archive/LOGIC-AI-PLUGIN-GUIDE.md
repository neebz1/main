# 🎚️ Logic Pro AI Plugin - LIVE Real-Time Control

## 🔥 NO MORE EXPORT/IMPORT!

This AI plugin works **LIVE inside Logic Pro** - no bouncing, no waiting, just real-time magic!

---

## ✨ Features

### Real-Time Control
- ✅ **Play/Stop/Record** - Voice or text commands
- ✅ **Track controls** - Volume, pan, mute, solo
- ✅ **Tempo changes** - Instant BPM adjustment
- ✅ **Plugin parameters** - Automate any setting
- ✅ **Screen vision** - AI sees Logic Pro continuously
- ✅ **No export needed** - Works while you produce!

### Two Modes Available:

#### Mode 1: OSC Control (Most Powerful)
- Full parameter automation
- Plugin control
- Real-time feedback
- **Requires:** OSC setup in Logic Pro

#### Mode 2: Direct Control (Easiest)
- Transport control (play/stop/record)
- Track management
- Tempo/time signature
- **Requires:** Nothing! Works immediately

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Direct Control - No Setup!)

### Just run it:
```bash
./start-logic-ai-plugin.sh
```

### Then use commands:
```
🎚️ > play
✅ Playing

🎚️ > tempo 140
✅ Tempo set to 140 BPM

🎚️ > help
🤖 [AI analyzes your Logic Pro screen and gives advice]

🎚️ > screen
🤖 [AI describes what it sees and suggests improvements]
```

**That's it! No export/import, works in real-time!**

## 🎯 How It Works

### Architecture:
```
┌──────────────────┐
│   Logic Pro      │
│   (Your DAW)     │
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
         v
┌──────────────────┐
│  AI Plugin       │ ← Text/Voice commands
│  (Python + OSC)  │ ← Sees screen continuously
│                  │ ← Controls Logic directly
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
         v
┌──────────────────┐
│  Google Gemini   │
│  (Vision AI)     │
│  Real-time       │
└──────────────────┘
```

### What Happens:
1. **AI captures Logic Pro screen** every 2 seconds
2. **You type or speak** a command
3. **AI analyzes** screen + command
4. **Executes directly** in Logic Pro
5. **No export/import!** Live control!

## 💡 Example Commands

### Transport Control
```
play              → Starts playback
stop              → Stops playback  
record            → Starts recording
```

### Project Control
```
tempo 140         → Sets tempo to 140 BPM
timesig 3/4       → Sets time signature
save              → Saves project
```

### AI Analysis
```
help              → AI analyzes screen and gives advice
screen            → AI describes what it sees
analyze           → Full mixing analysis
fix this          → AI suggests and applies fixes
```

### Track Control (with OSC)
```
mute track 3      → Mutes track 3
solo track 1      → Solos track 1
volume track 2 -3db → Lowers track 2 by 3dB
```

## ⚙️ OSC Setup (Advanced Features)

### Enable OSC in Logic Pro:

1. **Logic Pro** → **Control Surfaces** → **Setup**
2. Click **New** → **Install**
3. Select **OSC** (Open Sound Control)
4. Configure:
   - Incoming Port: **8000**
   - Outgoing Port: **9000**
   - IP Address: **127.0.0.1** (localhost)
5. Click **Apply**

### What This Enables:
- Full plugin parameter control
- Track automation writing
- Channel strip control
- Effects parameter automation
- Real-time mixing adjustments

---

## 🎹 Scripter Plugin (Optional)

I also created a **Logic Pro Scripter** plugin!

### Install:
1. In Logic Pro, add a **Scripter** MIDI plugin
2. Click **Open Script in Editor**
3. Copy contents from: `LogicAI_Scripter.js`
4. Paste into Scripter editor
5. Click **Run Script**

### What it does:
- Triggers AI analysis every 16 beats
- Can receive automation from AI
- Native MIDI plugin workflow

## 🆚 Comparison

### Old Way (Export/Import):
```
1. Make music in Logic
2. Export to WAV (30 seconds)
3. Upload to AI tool
4. Wait for analysis
5. Read suggestions
6. Manually apply in Logic
7. Repeat

Total time: ~5-10 minutes per iteration
```

### New Way (Live Plugin):
```
1. Make music in Logic
2. Type "analyze"
3. AI sees screen immediately
4. Get instant suggestions
5. AI applies changes directly
6. Continue producing!

Total time: ~10 seconds
```

**30x FASTER!** ⚡

## 💬 Example Session

```bash
./start-logic-ai-plugin.sh
```

```
🎚️ > play
✅ Playing

🎚️ > screen
🤖 AI: I can see Logic Pro with a drum track and bass track. 
       The bass track appears to be clipping - the level meter 
       is hitting red. I recommend reducing the gain by 3-4 dB.

🎚️ > fix this
🤖 AI: Analyzing... I'll reduce the bass track volume.
✅ Set track 2 volume to 0.7

🎚️ > tempo 128
✅ Tempo set to 128 BPM

🎚️ > help with the mix
🤖 AI: Looking at your mix:
       - Drums sound good, nice punch
       - Bass is now fixed (no clipping)
       - I don't see any melodic elements yet
       - Suggestion: Add a pad or melody on track 3
       - The frequency spectrum looks balanced

🎚️ > record
✅ Recording

[You record a melody]

🎚️ > stop
✅ Stopped

🎚️ > analyze the new track
🤖 AI: The melody you just recorded is in the mid-range (500-2kHz).
       Sounds like a synth pad. I recommend:
       - Add some reverb for space
       - Pan slightly left to balance the stereo field
       - Apply a high-pass filter at 200 Hz to keep it clean
       
       Want me to apply these?

🎚️ > yes
✅ [AI applies the suggested changes via OSC]

🎚️ > play
✅ Playing

[Listen to the AI's improvements in real-time!]
```

## 💡 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Real-time Mixing
```
While producing:
> help
AI: Your kick drum is too loud relative to the bass
> fix this
AI applies volume automation
> play
Listen to the improvement!
```

### Use Case 2: Creative Flow
```
Recording:
> record
[Play your part]
> stop
> what do you think?
AI: Great take! The timing is solid. I'd add some 
    reverb and pan it slightly right.
> do it
AI applies effects
```

### Use Case 3: Learning
```
> what should I do next?
AI: Looking at your arrangement, I recommend:
    1. Add a hi-hat pattern for energy
    2. Create a breakdown at bar 32
    3. Add automation to the filter on the synth
