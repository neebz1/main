### What Happens When You Speak:

1. **Microphone** captures your voice
2. **Speech Recognition** converts to text
3. **Screen Capture** takes screenshot of Logic Pro
4. **Gemini AI** receives:
   - Your voice command (text)
   - Screenshot of Logic Pro screen
5. **AI analyzes** both and decides what to do
6. **Function Calling** executes Logic Pro command
7. **Text-to-Speech** speaks AI's response

## 🎨 Example Conversations

### Example 1: Basic Control

**You:** "Hey Assistant"  
**AI:** "Yes?"  
**You:** "Start recording"  
**AI:** *clicks Record button* "Started recording"  
**You:** "Stop"  
**AI:** *stops playback* "Stopped"

### Example 2: Analysis

**You:** "Hey Assistant"  
**AI:** "Yes?"  
**You:** "What do you see on my screen?"  
**AI:** "I can see Logic Pro with a drum track, a bass track, and a vocal track. The vocal track appears to be clipping based on the level meters. Would you like me to help you fix that?"  
**You:** "Yes please"  
**AI:** "I recommend reducing the gain on the vocal track by about 3-6 dB. You can do this with the track volume fader or add a Gain plugin at the start of the chain."

### Example 3: Workflow

**You:** "Hey Assistant"  
**AI:** "Yes?"  
**You:** "Set tempo to 128 and add a MIDI track"  
**AI:** *executes both commands* "Done! Tempo is now 128 BPM and I've added a MIDI track."

### Example 4: Mixing Advice

**You:** "Hey Assistant"  
**AI:** "Yes?"  
**You:** "This mix sounds muddy, what should I do?"  
**AI:** *analyzes screen* "Looking at your EQ settings, I notice you have a lot of low-mid frequency buildup around 200-400 Hz on multiple tracks. I recommend:  
1. High-pass filter on non-bass instruments at 80-100 Hz  
2. Cut 250-350 Hz by 2-3 dB on vocals and guitars  
3. Make sure your bass and kick aren't fighting - use EQ to carve space"

## 💡 Advanced Usage

### Continuous Monitoring Mode

The assistant can run continuously and offer suggestions:

```python
# Future enhancement
assistant.run_monitoring_mode()
# AI watches your screen and offers tips
# "I notice your track is clipping"
# "That's a lot of plugins - consider CPU usage"
```

### Screen Context

The AI **always sees your screen** when you activate it, so you can ask:
- "What's that plugin doing?"
- "Is this track muted?"
- "How many bars is this?"
- "What key is this in?"

### Custom Commands

You can extend the system with custom functions:

```python
def apply_eq_preset(preset_name: str):
    # Load EQ preset in Logic Pro
    script = f'''
    tell application "Logic Pro"
        -- Load preset
    end tell
    '''
    return run_applescript(script)
```

Add to function declarations and the AI can use it!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'google.generativeai'"

```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

### "pyaudio not found"

# Install PortAudio first
brew install portaudio

# Then install PyAudio
pip install pyaudio
```

### "Microphone not working"

1. Check **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **Microphone**
2. Grant permission to Terminal/Python
3. Test microphone with: `python -m speech_recognition`

### "Logic Pro not responding to commands"

1. Make sure Logic Pro is **running and frontmost**
2. Check **Accessibility permissions**:
   - System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Accessibility
   - Grant permission to Terminal

### "API Key Invalid"

1. Check `.env` file has correct key
2. Verify at: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
3. Make sure no extra spaces in .env

### "Screen capture is black"

macOS **screen recording permission** needed:
- System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Screen Recording
- Add Terminal to allowed apps

## 🎯 Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Be Natural
Talk naturally! The AI understands context.

**Good:**
- "Start recording please"
- "Can you set the tempo to 140?"
- "What's wrong with this mix?"

**Also Works:**
- "Record"
- "140 BPM"
- "Analyze this"

### Tip 2: Use Screen Context
The AI sees your screen, so reference it:
- "Fix that clipping"
- "What's that plugin?"
- "Is this track solo'd?"

### Tip 3: Chain Commands
You can give multiple instructions:
- "Save the project and add a new track"
- "Set tempo to 128, toggle metronome, and start recording"

### Tip 4: Ask for Explanations
Don't just get commands - learn!
- "Why is this muddy?"
- "What does that EQ setting do?"
- "How should I compress this?"

### Tip 5: Workflow Assistance
Use it to speed up your workflow:
- "What's the next step in mixing?"
- "Should I add more reverb?"
- "Is this ready to master?"
