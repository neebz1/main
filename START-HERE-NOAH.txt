━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💻 TERMINAL COMMANDS (Open Terminal, type these)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

eza               See files with pretty colors and icons
bat <filename>    Read a file with syntax colors
fastfetch         See info about your computer
btop              Monitor what's using your CPU/memory (press 'q' to exit)

Example:
  Open Terminal → type "eza" → press Enter → see pretty file list!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📚 SEARCH DOCUMENTATION (When coding in Cursor)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

When you need to know "how to do X with library Y":

1. Open Terminal
2. Type these 3 commands:
   cd ~/CursorDocsIndex
   source venv/bin/activate
   python docs_cli.py lookup "your question"

3. You get the REAL documentation with code examples

4. Copy that into Cursor AI:
   "Based on this documentation: [paste]... write code for me"

5. Cursor uses REAL docs instead of guessing!

Example:
  python docs_cli.py lookup "how to make POST requests"
  → Returns actual code examples from official docs

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 OPTIONAL STUFF (Only if you want these features)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Want AI to answer coding questions in terminal?
  → Need to set up Bitwarden + API keys
  → Guide: ~/main/vibe-setup/NEXT-STEPS.md
  → Skip if you're happy using Cursor AI directly

Want to access docs from other computers?
  → Deploy to cloud with: cd ~/CursorDocsIndex && ./deploy.sh
  → Skip if you only use this Mac

Want prettier terminal font?
  → Download JetBrains Mono from: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/
  → Skip if current font looks fine

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚀 TRY THESE RIGHT NOW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
