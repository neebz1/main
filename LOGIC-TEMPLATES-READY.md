## ‚úÖ What I've Set Up For You

I've created complete guides and scripts to set up Logic Pro templates optimized for your KeyLab MIDI controller. Since I can't directly control Logic Pro's GUI, I've created detailed step-by-step guides you can follow.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (Choose One)

### Option 1: Guided Interactive Setup (Recommended)
```bash
./setup-logic-now.sh
```
This script will walk you through every step of setting up Logic Pro with your KeyLab, including creating your first template.

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Read the template guide:
```bash
open ~/Music/Audio\ Music\ Apps/Project\ Templates/Custom\ Templates/TEMPLATE_GUIDE.txt
```

2. Follow the instructions to create templates manually

## üéµ Templates You Can Create

### 1. **MIDI Beat Production** (Recommended First)
**Best for:** Hip-hop, trap, electronic beats
**Tracks:** 8 MIDI instruments + 4 Audio tracks

Setup includes:
- Drums (Drummer or drum kit)
- 808 Bass (heavy sub bass)
- Synth Lead
- Synth Pad
- Keys/Piano
- Pluck/Arp
- FX/Riser
- Sampler (for vocal chops)

**Your KeyLab:** Play any track, use faders for volume, transport buttons control Logic

---

### 2. **Live Recording + MIDI**
**Best for:** Recording vocals/instruments with MIDI backing
**Tracks:** 4 MIDI + 8 Audio tracks

Perfect for:

### 3. **Quick Sketch / Idea Capture**
**Best for:** Fast idea capture, jamming

Use this when:
- You have a quick idea

**Workflow:** Press record and go - everything is pre-loaded

**Best for:** Chopping samples, boom-bap, lo-fi
**Tracks:** Specialized for sampling

Includes:
- Multiple Quick Samplers

**Your KeyLab:** Play chopped samples across the keys

---

### 5. **MIDI Orchestra / Layers**
**Best for:** Massive layered sounds, experimental
**Tracks:** 16 MIDI tracks for complex arrangements

Build huge sounds:
- 4-layer synth stacks
- Rhythm section

**Your KeyLab:** Play across all layers, sculpt with faders
