## 🚀 How to Use Your Apps

### Option 1: Quick Start Scripts
```bash
# AI Assistant (recommended to try first)
./start-live-ai-assistant.sh

# AI Mixing Engineer
./start-ai-mixing-engineer.sh

# API Server
./start-api.sh

# All services at once
./spawn-all-ai-services.sh
```

### Option 2: Direct Python Execution
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run any app
python3 ai_mixing_engineer.py
python3 live_ai_assistant.py
python3 cloud_ai_builder.py
```

### Option 3: Use Cursor (Easiest!)
Just press `Cmd+K` in Cursor to generate code with AI - no setup needed!

## 🔧 Handy Tools I Created For You

### 1. Configuration Checker
```bash
./check-mac-config.sh
```
Runs a comprehensive check of your entire system configuration.

### 2. App Launch Tester
```bash
./test-app-launch.sh
```
Tests that all apps can import their dependencies.

### 3. Bitwarden Health Check
```bash
./bw-health-check.sh
```
Verifies API key management system.

### 4. Security Check
```bash
./security-check.sh
```
Runs security audit on your setup.

---

## 🎯 Recommended First Steps

### 1. Try the Live AI Assistant (30 seconds)
```bash
./start-live-ai-assistant.sh
```
Opens in your browser - just start chatting!

### 2. Or Use Cursor Right Now
- Open Cursor
- Press `Cmd+K`
- Type: "create a simple website"
- Watch it generate code!

### 3. Check Out the Guides
- `START-HERE.md` - Quick start guide
- `MAC-CONFIG-STATUS.md` - Detailed config info
- `API-README.md` - API documentation

## ⚠️ Minor Notes (Non-Critical)

### SSL Warning
You might see: `NotOpenSSLWarning: urllib3 v2 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+`

**Impact:** NONE - This is just a warning. Your system uses LibreSSL 2.8.3 which works perfectly fine for all operations. You can safely ignore this.

### Zoxide Messages
You might see zoxide configuration messages in terminal.

**Impact:** NONE - Doesn't affect Python apps at all. Optional fix: add `eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"` to end of `~/.zshrc`

---

## 🛠️ If Something Doesn't Work

### Step 1: Check Configuration
```bash
./check-mac-config.sh
```

### Step 2: Check Logs
```bash
ls -la logs/
cat logs/[app-name].log
```

### Step 3: Verify Virtual Environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
which python3  # Should show venv path
```

### Step 4: Test Imports
```bash
./test-app-launch.sh
```

### Step 5: Reinstall Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```
