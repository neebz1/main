# ‚ùì GitHub Beginner's FAQ

Quick answers to common GitHub questions for newcomers.

## ü§î Basic Questions

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a website where you store and share your code. Think of it like "Google Drive for programmers."

### What is Git?
Git is a tool that tracks changes to your files. It's like "Track Changes" in Microsoft Word, but for code.

### What's the difference?
- **Git** = The tool on your computer
- **GitHub** = The website where you store your code online

## üìÅ Repository Questions

### What is a repository?
A repository (or "repo") is like a project folder. It contains all your files and the history of changes.

### How many repositories should I have?
- One repository per project
- Don't put multiple unrelated projects in one repo
- Keep your main account clean with 5-10 active repos

### Should I delete old repositories?
- **Yes** if they're just test projects or duplicates
- **Archive** them instead of deleting if you might need them later
- **Keep** finished projects to show your work

---

## üßπ Cleanup Questions

### Why is my repository so cluttered?
Common reasons:
- Too many documentation files
- Old test files you forgot to delete
- Duplicate scripts and configs
- Files that shouldn't be on GitHub (.env, node_modules, etc.)

### What files should NEVER be on GitHub?
- **Passwords and API keys** (.env files)
- **Dependencies** (node_modules/, venv/)
- **Build artifacts** (dist/, build/, *.pyc)
- **Personal data** (databases, private info)
- **System files** (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)

### How do I prevent files from being uploaded?
Add them to `.gitignore`:
```
# .gitignore
.env
.DS_Store
*.pyc
__pycache__/
venv/
node_modules/
```

## üîê Security Questions

### I accidentally uploaded my API key! What do I do?
1. **IMMEDIATELY** change/revoke the API key
2. Delete the file from your repo
3. Commit and push the deletion
4. **Important:** The key is STILL in Git history!
5. If it's critical, you may need to reset the entire repo

### How do I keep my .env file private?
1. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
2. Never commit the .env file
3. Create a `.env.example` file with fake values to show what keys are needed

### Can people see my deleted files on GitHub?
Yes! Git keeps history of everything. Deleting a file doesn't remove it from history.

## üíª Command Questions

### What do these commands do?

```bash
git status          # Shows what files changed
git add .           # Stages all changes
git commit -m "msg" # Saves changes with a message
git push            # Uploads to GitHub
git pull            # Downloads from GitHub
```

### How do I undo a commit?
```bash
# Undo last commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit and discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### How do I delete a file from Git?
```bash
# Delete file from both computer and Git
git rm file.txt
git commit -m "Delete file.txt"
git push

# Delete from Git but keep on computer
git rm --cached file.txt
git commit -m "Remove file.txt from Git"
git push
```

## üìä Organization Questions

### How many files should a repository have?
- **Small project:** 10-20 files
- **Medium project:** 20-50 files
- **Large project:** 50-200 files
- **Too many:** 200+ files (consider organizing into folders)

### How should I organize my files?
```
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Overview
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE            # Legal
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore         # What to ignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/               # Source code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/             # Test files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/              # Documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt   # Dependencies
```

### Should I have multiple README files?
**No!** One main README.md is enough. If you need more docs, create a `docs/` folder.

## ü§ù Collaboration Questions

### What is a branch?
A branch is like a copy of your code where you can make changes without affecting the main version.

### What is a pull request?
A pull request (PR) asks to merge your changes into the main code. It's how teams review changes.

### What is a fork?
A fork is your own copy of someone else's repository. You can make changes without affecting theirs.

## üéØ Best Practices

### Commit Messages
**Bad:**
- "update"
- "fix"
- "changes"

**Good:**
- "Add user login feature"
- "Fix crash when clicking submit button"
- "Update README with setup instructions"

### File Naming
**Bad:**
- `final.py`
- `script2.py`
- `test123.py`

**Good:**
- `music_ai_assistant.py`
- `user_authentication.py`
- `test_login_functionality.py`

### Repository Description
**Bad:**
- "my project"
- "code"
- (empty)

**Good:**
- "AI music production assistant for Logic Pro"
- "Personal website built with React and Node.js"
- "Python script to automate email organization"
