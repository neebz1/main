## 📊 What Gets Deployed

When you say "deploy everything", the agents automatically:

1. Load your Bitwarden credentials (silently)
2. Deploy these services:
   - **AI Mixing Engineer** → http://localhost:7861
   - **Music Copilot** → http://localhost:7860
   - **Live AI Assistant**
   - **Logic AI Plugin**
3. Start monitoring (auto-restarts if anything crashes)
4. Log everything to `agents/monitoring.log`

**All in the background - you don't see anything!**
