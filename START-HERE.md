2. **Press `Cmd+K`** anywhere in your code
   - Type what you want: "create a website"
   - AI writes the code for you
   - Press Enter to accept

3. **Press `Cmd+L`** to chat with AI
   - Ask questions
   - Get explanations
   - Debug code

4. **Install GitHub Copilot** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   /Applications/Cursor.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/cursor --install-extension GitHub.copilot
   ```
   Then sign in with your GitHub account in Cursor

**That's it! Start coding.**

## 🎵 Step 2: Use Logic Pro Copilot (ALREADY WORKS!)

Your music production AI assistant is ready to use:

```bash
cd /Users/nr/main
python3 logic_copilot_lite.py
```

It will open in your browser. Ask it anything about:
- Logic Pro tips
- How to make beats
- Mixing and production
- Sound design

**No setup needed - just run it!**
