## What You Actually Have:

### 1. **Cursor's Built-in AI** ✅ (Free with Cursor)
- Better than Copilot for most tasks
- Works immediately, no setup

### 2. **Cline** ✅ (Already installed - `saoudrizwan.claude-dev`)
- AI coding agent that can build entire features
- Uses your OpenRouter API key (you have this!)

### 3. **GitHub Copilot** 
- If you have a paid subscription, you need VS Code (not Cursor)
- OR use Cursor's built-in AI instead (it's better!)

## 🎯 How to Use CLINE (The Powerful One!)

Cline is already installed in Cursor. Here's how to find and use it:

### Step 1: Open Cline in Cursor

**Method A: Command Palette**
1. Press `⌘⇧P` (Command + Shift + P)
2. Type "Cline"
3. Select "Cline: Open In New Tab"

**Method B: Sidebar**
- Look for the Cline icon in the left sidebar (activity bar)
- It looks like a robot/chat icon
- Click it!

### Step 2: Configure Cline (IMPORTANT!)

Cline needs your API key. I already set it up for you in Cursor settings:
- **Provider:** OpenRouter
- **API Key:** Your OpenRouter key (already configured!)
- **Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet

**To verify it's working:**
1. Open Cursor settings: `⌘,` (Command + comma)
2. Search for "cline"
3. Check that `cline.apiKey` is set

### Step 3: Use Cline

Once Cline is open:
1. Type what you want to build: "Create a todo app"
2. Cline will:
   - Read your files
   - Write code
   - Create new files
   - Run commands
   - Test everything
3. Review and approve each step

**Cline is like having a junior developer!**

## 💰 What About GitHub Copilot?

**If you have a Copilot subscription:**

**Option A:** Use it in VS Code (not Cursor)
- Download VS Code
- Install GitHub Copilot extension
- Sign in with GitHub

**Option B:** Cancel it and use Cursor's AI instead
- Cursor's AI is free and often better
- You're already paying for Cursor
- Save $10/month

**My recommendation:** Try Cursor's built-in AI for a week. If you like it, cancel Copilot.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "I can't find Cline!"

1. **Restart Cursor completely:**
   - Press `⌘Q` to quit Cursor
   - Reopen Cursor
   - Look for Cline icon in left sidebar

2. **Use Command Palette:**
   - Press `⌘⇧P`
   - Type "Cline: Open"
   - Hit Enter

3. **Check if it's installed:**
   - Settings → Extensions
   - Search "Cline"
   - Should see "saoudrizwan.claude-dev"

### "Cline says no API key!"

The API key is already set! But if it doesn't work:
1. Press `⌘,` (settings)
2. Search "cline.apiKey"
3. It should show your OpenRouter key
4. If blank, add: `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`

### "Cursor's AI doesn't work!"

Cursor has its own free trial, then requires a subscription:
- First 2 weeks: Free
- Then: $20/month for unlimited AI
- Worth it! Cancels out need for Copilot
