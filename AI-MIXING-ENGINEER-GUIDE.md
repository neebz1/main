### 2. Export Audio from Logic Pro

#### Option A: Bounce Full Mix
1. In Logic Pro: **File** ‚Üí **Bounce** ‚Üí **Project or Section**
2. Choose **WAV** format
3. Save to your Desktop or Downloads

#### Option B: Bounce Individual Stems
1. Solo the track you want to analyze
2. **File** ‚Üí **Bounce** ‚Üí **Track in Place**
3. Export as WAV

### 3. Upload and Analyze

1. **Upload your audio file** to the AI Mixing Engineer
2. **Select your genre** from the dropdown
3. **(Optional)** Add production goals like:
   - "Need more punch in the drums"
   - "Preparing for Spotify release"
   - "Vocal sounds muddy"
   - "Want more width in the mix"
4. **Click "Analyze & Get Suggestions"**

### 4. Review Results

You'll get:
- ‚úÖ **Technical analysis** (dynamic range, loudness, frequency balance)
- ‚úÖ **AI mixing suggestions** (what to adjust and how)
- ‚úÖ **Waveform visualization**
- ‚úÖ **Spectrogram** (frequency over time)

### 5. Apply to Logic Pro

Take the suggestions and apply them:
- Use **Channel EQ** for frequency adjustments
- Use **Compressor** with recommended settings
- Adjust **levels and panning** as suggested
- Re-export and compare!

## üìñ Understanding the Analysis

### Dynamic Range
- **>15 dB** - Very natural, excellent dynamics
- **10-15 dB** - Good dynamics, punchy
- **6-10 dB** - Modern compression (streaming-ready)
- **<6 dB** - Heavy compression (may sound squashed)

### Loudness
- **>-6 dB** - Too loud! Likely clipping
- **-14 to -6 dB** - Commercial loudness
- **-23 to -14 dB** - Good mix level (room for mastering)
- **<-23 dB** - Too quiet, needs level boost

### Peak Level
- **>-0.1 dBFS** - ‚ùå CLIPPING! Reduce gain
- **-1 to -0.1 dBFS** - ‚ö†Ô∏è Danger zone
- **-3 to -1 dBFS** - ‚úÖ Good headroom
- **<-3 dBFS** - ‚úÖ Plenty of headroom for mastering

### Spectral Centroid (Brightness)
- **>3 kHz** - Very bright/harsh (high-cut EQ needed)
- **2-3 kHz** - Bright (modern mix)
- **1-2 kHz** - Balanced
- **<1 kHz** - Dark/muddy (add high-end)

## üí° Pro Workflow Tips

### Iterative Mixing
1. **Export initial mix** ‚Üí Analyze
2. **Apply AI suggestions** in Logic Pro
3. **Export again** ‚Üí Re-analyze
4. **Compare results** and fine-tune
5. **Repeat** until satisfied

### Track-by-Track Analysis
- Analyze individual stems (vocals, drums, bass)
- Get specific suggestions for each element
- Build a better overall mix

### A/B Reference Comparison
1. Analyze your mix
2. Analyze a professional reference track in the same genre
3. Compare the metrics
4. Adjust your mix to match

### Pre-Mastering Check
- Export your final mix
- Analyze for clipping, loudness, and balance
- Fix issues before sending to mastering

## üéØ Common Fixes

### "My mix sounds muddy"
AI will suggest:
- High-pass filters on non-bass instruments
- Cuts in 200-400 Hz range
- Clarity boost around 2-5 kHz

### "Drums don't punch"
AI will suggest:
- Compression with fast attack, medium release
- Boost around 60-100 Hz (kick) and 3-5 kHz (snare)
- Side-chain compression on bass

### "Too harsh/fatiguing"
AI will suggest:
- De-esser or high-frequency cuts
- Reduce 2-8 kHz range
- Parallel compression for warmth

### "Vocals get lost in the mix"
AI will suggest:
- Boost around 2-4 kHz (presence)
- Compression to even out dynamics
- Cut competing frequencies in other tracks
