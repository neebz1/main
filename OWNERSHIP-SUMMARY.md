- OPENAI_API_KEY
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- Any other keys you add
```

### 2. Self-Hosted AI Suite

## 💰 Cost Comparison

### Traditional SaaS Approach
```
Paid Services:
- AI API Platform:        $50-200/month

- API Gateway:            $50-200/month

Total: $150-650/month = $1,800-7,800/year
Plus: Vendor lock-in, data privacy concerns
```

### Your Approach (Self-Hosted)
```
Your Infrastructure:
- Bitwarden (free tier):  $0/month
- Self-hosted apps:       $0/month
- REST API:               $0/month

## 🔐 The One Password to Rule Them All

```
Bitwarden Master Password
           │
           ├─→ Google API Key
           ├─→ OpenAI API Key
           ├─→ Together AI Key
           ├─→ Anthropic Key
           ├─→ Any other service
           │
           └─→ bwload → All available in apps!
```

**One password = Access to everything!**

## 🎯 Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Build New App
```bash
# Create new app
vim my_new_app.py

# Use ANY API key
import os
api_key = os.getenv('GOOGLE_API_KEY')  # Already loaded!

# Run it
python my_new_app.py  # Just works!
```

### Scenario 2: Onboard Team Member
```bash
# They do (once):
curl POST /auth/register

# They get:
- Access to all tools
- Same API backend
- Shared resources

# You do:
Nothing! It's automated!
```

### Scenario 3: Rotate API Key
```bash
# Update in Bitwarden
./bw-add-key.sh "Google API Key" "new-key"

# Reload
bwload

# Done!
# All apps now use new key
```

### Scenario 4: Deploy New Environment
```bash
# Generate config
./.env-from-bitwarden.sh

# Deploy
docker-compose up

# Done!
# All keys automatically configured
```
